CMake Warning at /opt/homebrew/lib/cmake/Qt6/QtFeature.cmake:1263 (message):
  This project was initially configured with the Qt feature "opensslv30" set
  to "OFF".  While loading the "Qt6::Core" package, the value of the feature
  has changed to "ON".  That might cause a project rebuild due to updated C++
  headers.

  In case of build issues, consider removing the CMakeCache.txt file and
  reconfiguring the project.
